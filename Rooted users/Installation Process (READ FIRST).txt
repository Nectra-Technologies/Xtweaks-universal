Troubleshoot
______________________________________
1. My phone isn't booting:
- Your device is most likely not supported, simsung tweaks currently only supports the S8, S8+, S9, S9+, S10, S10e, S10+, Galaxy grand prime (gen 1)

2. Netflix still doesn't work
- This is very strange bug it happen if it does try using magiskhide or try reflash a newer version of the debloater.

3. Netflix suddently stops working
- This is a very strange but but it does happen, if so you just need to reflash the debloater then it should fix it.

4. Does simsung tweaks collect my info or any diagnostics?
- NO, we don't collect anything.

5. The debloater is giving me a error
- This is a very recent bug that started with the v0.2 and we're working on it. It you get the error a restart should fix it.

6. Does simsung have access to my pics?
- No, we just remove useless stuff on your phone that's it.
