============= Simsung Tweaks by mraif13 ==============================================
======= Make your device faster, lighter and bloatware free =====================================

Welcome to Command List Lite
 This is a more liter, friendly version of the command list. This is the command I actually use on my device. This command list will take longer to get updated or might just never get updates. It's currently empty but I'm working on it as we speak most likely it's going to get release later this month.

Notice: All these commands have been tested, but I cannot make sure it works on every device ever. Please use this at your own risk. I'm not responsible for any damage caused.
Thanks to: James, Adel and Muhammed for testing.

Change Log v1.0:
- Created file.
