Troubleshoot
______________________________________
1. My phone isn't booting:
- Your device is most likely not supported, simsung tweaks currently has only been tested on the S8, S8+, S9, S9+, S10, S10e, S10+, Galaxy grand prime (gen 1)

2. Netflix still doesn't work
- This is very strange bug, but it happen if it does try using magiskhide or try reflashing a newer version of the debloater.

3. Netflix suddently stops working *insert crying cat meme*
- This is a very strange bug but it does happen, if it does happen to you just need to reflash the debloater it should fix it.

4. Does simsung tweaks collect my info or any diagnostics?
- NO, we don't collect anything. Not even your browser history.

5. The debloater is giving me a error of some sort Wtf?
- This is a very recent bug that started with the v0.2 and I'm working on it. It you get the error a restart should fix it, if that doesn't luck try a older version.

6. Does simsung tweaks have access to my Snapchat pics that I usually send my friends?
- No, we just remove useless stuff on your phone that's it, it's not that hard to understand.

7. Twrp error 6?
- Might be because I fuck up with something try using a older version. Am sorry :(
